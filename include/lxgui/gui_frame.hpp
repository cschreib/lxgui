    /// A #uiobject that can contain other objects and react to events.
    /** This class, which is at the core of the UI design, can contain
    *   other frames as "children", and layered regions sorted by layers
    *   (text, images, ...). A frame can also react to events, and register
    *   callbacks to be executed on particular events (key presses, etc.)
    *   or on every tick.
    *
    *   Each frame has an optional "title region", which can be used to
    *   define and draw a title bar. This title bar can then be used to
    *   move the frame around the screen using mouse click and drag.
    *   Furthermore, frames have optional support for resizing by click
    *   and drag on corners or edges (opt in).
    *
    *   Frames can either move freely on the screen, or be "clamped" to the
    *   screen so they cannot be partly outside of their render area.
    *
    *   __Rendering.__ Frames are grouped into different "strata", which are
    *   rendered sequentially. Frames in a high strata will always be rendered
    *   above frames in a low strata. Then, within a strata, frames are further
    *   sorted by "level"; within this particular strata, a frame with a high
    *   level will always be rendered above all frames with a lower level, but
    *   it will still remain below other frames in a higher strata. The level
    *   of a frame is automatically set to the maximum level inside the strata
    *   when the frame is clicked, which effectively brings the frame to the
    *   front.
    *
    *   __Children and regions.__ When a frame is hidden, all its children
    *   and regions will also be hidden. Likewise, deleting a frame will
    *   automatically delete all its children and regions, unless they are
    *   detached first. Other than this, children and regions do not need to
    *   be located inside the frame; this is controlled purely by their anchors.
    *   Therefore, if a child is not anchored to its parent, moving the parent
    *   will not automatically move the child.
    *
    *   __Events.__ Frames can react to events. For this to happen, a callback
    *   function must be registered to handle the corresponding event. There are
    *   two types of events. First: hard-coded UI events such as `OnKeyPress`
    *   or `OnUpdate`, which are automatically triggered by lxgui. Second:
    *   generic events, which can be triggered from various sources and all
    *   forwarded to the `OnEvent` callback. Generic events are typically
    *   generated by whatever application is being driven by lxgui (i.e., your
    *   game), and they enable application-specific behavior (for example:
    *   changing the UI when the player is under attack will likely require an
    *   `"UNDER_ATTACK"` event).
    *
    *   To use the first type of events (hard-coded events), all you have to
    *   do in general is register a callback function using frame::set_script.
    *   However, some hard-coded events require explicit enabling. In particular:
    *
    *   - Events related to keyboard input (`OnKeyDown`, `OnKeyUp`) require
    *   frame::enable_keyboard.
    *   - Events related to mouse input (`OnDragStart`, `OnEnter`,
    *   `OnLeave`, `OnMouseUp`, `OnMouseDown`, `OnMouseWheel`, `OnReceiveDrag`)
    *   require frame::enable_mouse.
    *
    *   To use the second type of events (generic events), you have to register
    *   a callback for `OnEvent` _and_ register the frame for each generic event
    *   you wish to listen to. This is done with frame::register_event.
    *
    *   Some events provide arguments to the registered callback function. For
    *   example, the application can fire a `"UNIT_ATTACKED"` event when a unit
    *   is under attack, and pass the ID of the attacked unit as a first argument,
    *   and the ID of the attacker as a second argument. If a callback
    *   function is registered using frame::set_script, these arguments can be
    *   handled and named like regular function parameters. In XML callback
    *   handlers, they can be accessed with the hard-coded generic names `arg1`,
    *   `arg2`, etc.
    *
    *   Hard-coded events available to all frames:
    *
    *   - `OnDragStart`: Triggered when one of the mouse button registered for
    *   dragging (see frame::register_for_drag) has been pressed inside the
    *   area of the screen occupied by the frame, and a mouse movement is first
    *   recorded.
    *   - `OnEnter`: Triggered when the mouse pointer enters into the area of
    *   the screen occupied by the frame. Note: this only takes into account the
    *   position and size of the frame and its title region, but not the space
    *   occupied by its children or layered regions. Will not trigger if the
    *   frame is hidden.
    *   - `OnEvent`: Triggered when a registered generic event occurs. See
    *   frame::register_event. To allow distinguishing which event has just
    *   been fired, the registered callback function is always provided with a
    *   first argument that is set to a string matching the event name. Further
    *   arguments can be passed to the callback and are handled as for other events.
    *   - `OnHide`: Triggered when uiobject::hide is called, or when the frame
    *   is hidden indirectly (for example if its parent is itself hidden). This
    *   will only fire if the frame was previously shown.
    *   - `OnKeyDown`: Triggered when any keyboard key is pressed. Will not
    *   trigger if the frame is hidden. This event provides two arguments to
    *   the registered callback: a number identifying the key, and the
    *   human-readable name of the key.
    *   - `OnKeyUp`: Triggered when any keyboard key is released. Will not
    *   trigger if the frame is hidden. This event provides two arguments to
    *   the registered callback: a number identifying the key, and the
    *   human-readable name of the key.
    *   - `OnLeave`: Triggered when the mouse pointer leaves the area of the
    *   screen occupied by the frame. Note: this only takes into account the
    *   position and size of the frame and its title region, but not the space
    *   occupied by its children or layered regions. Will not trigger if the
    *   frame is hidden, unless the frame was just hidden with the mouse
    *   previously inside the frame.
    *   - `OnLoad`: Triggered just after the frame is created. This is where
    *   you would normally register for events and specific inputs, set up
    *   initial states for extra logic, or do localization.
    *   - `OnMouseDown`: Triggered when any mouse button is pressed. Will not
    *   trigger if the frame is hidden. This event provides one argument to
    *   the registered callback: a string identifying the mouse button
    *   (`"LeftButton"`, `"RightButton"`, or `"MiddleButton"`).
    *   - `OnMouseUp`: Triggered when any mouse button is released. Will not
    *   trigger if the frame is hidden. This event provides one argument to
    *   the registered callback: a string identifying the mouse button
    *   (`"LeftButton"`, `"RightButton"`, or `"MiddleButton"`).
    *   - `OnMouseWheel`: Triggered when the mouse wheel is moved. This event
    *   provides one argument to the registered callback: a number indicating by
    *   how many "notches" the wheel has turned in this event. A positive value
    *   means the wheel has been moved "away" from the user (this would normally
    *   scroll *up* in a document).
    *   - `OnReceiveDrag`: Triggered when the mouse pointer was previously
    *   dragged onto the frame, and when one of the mouse button registered for
    *   dragging (see frame::register_for_drag) is released. This enables
    *   the "drop" in "drag and drop" operations.
    *   - `OnShow`: Triggered when uiobject::show is called, or when the frame
    *   is shown indirectly (for example if its parent is itself shown). This
    *   will only fire if the frame was previously hidden.
    *   - `OnSizeChanged`: Triggered whenever the size of the frame changes, either
    *   directly or indirectly. Be very careful not to call any function that could
    *   change the size of the frame inside this callback, as this would generate
    *   an infinite loop.
    *   - `OnUpdate`: Triggered on every tick of the game loop. This event provides
    *   one argument to the registered callback: a floating point number indicating
    *   how much time has passed since the last call to `OnUpdate` (in seconds).
    *   For optimal performance, prefer using other events types whenever possible.
    *   `OnUpdate` callbacks will be executed over and over again, and can quickly
    *   consume a lot of resources if user unreasonably. If you have to use
    *   `OnUpdate`, you can mitigate performance problems by artificially reducing
    *   the update rate: let the callback function only accumulate the time passed,
    *   and wait until enough time has passed (say, half a second) to execute any
    *   expensive operation. Then reset the accumulated time, and wait again.
    *
    *   Generic events fired natively by lxgui:
    *
    *   - `"LUA_ERROR"`: Triggered whenever a callback function or an addon script
    *   file generates a Lua error. This event provides one argument to the
    *   registered callback: a string containing the error message.
    *   - `"ADDON_LOADED"`: Triggered when an addon is fully loaded. This event
    *   provides one argument to the registered callback: a string containing the
    *   name of the loaded addon.
    *   - `"ENTERING_WORLD"`: Triggered once at the start of the program, at the
    *   end of the first update tick.
    *
    *   __Virtual frames.__ Virtual frames are not displayed on the screen,
    *   and technically are not part of the interface. They are only available
    *   as "templates" that can be reused by other (virtual or non-virtual)
    *   frames. This is useful for defining a few frame templates with a
    *   particular style, and then reuse these templates across the interface
    *   to ensure a consistent look. When inheriting from a virtual frame,
    *   the inheriting frame will copy all the registered callbacks, all the
    *   child frames, and all the layered regions of the virtual frame.
