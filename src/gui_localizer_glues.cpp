/** Global functions for localization / translation of text.
* The functions listed on this page are registered in the
* Lua state as globals, and as such are accessible from
* anywhere automatically. They provide all necessary functionalities
* for selecting languages and translating text for display in the GUI.
*
* **Translating text.** When creating a button in the GUI, it is tempting to set its
* displayed text directly like `button:set_text("Cancel")`, hence hard-coding the text
* in the code. This works totally fine, provided that English is the only language you
* only ever want to display to your users. If you want your game to be accessible to
* users from countries where English is not the native language, you will want to
* make that text translatable. This is what this module is for.
*
* **Translatable string codes.** The first change needed is to stop hard-coding *any*
* form of text in your GUI code (be it in layout files or Lua code). All text should be
* replaced by a "translatable string code", such as `"{button_cancel}"`. The purpose of
* this code is to uniquely represent this string you need to display, without giving it
* an actual content. The string `"{button_cancel}"` will not itself be displayed on the
* screen; instead, the localization system will search for a translation of that string
* and return the appropriate text (`"Cancel"` for English, `"Annuler"` for French,
* etc.).
*
* The translation is automatic when the string code is set in the layout file attributes,
* like the `text` attribute of the `FontString` or `Button` objects. This is only
* appropriate for translations that do not require additional inputs (see below).
*
*     <Button name="$parentButton" text="{button_cancel}">
*        ...
*     </Button>
*
* When setting the string code from Lua, e.g. by calling `set_text("...")`, the
* translation needs to be explicit. This is done by calling the @{localize_string}
* function, for example:
*
*    button:set_text(localize_string("{button_cancel}"))
*
* **Creating translations.** Once all the GUI code uses translatable string codes, all
* that remains is to write the translations for each string, in all the languages you
* want to support. The translation system is easily extensible: it is possible to add
* more languages or more translatable text at any point. Therefore, even if you are
* lacking translators for all the languages you need, it is a good practice to start
* writing at least the English translations (or whatever is your native language),
* and add the rest later.
*
* Each addon folder is automatically scanned for translations when the GUI is loaded.
* Translation files are Lua scripts, with name `{lang}{REGION}.lua`, where `{lang}`
* is a two-letter lowercase string identifying the language (e.g., `en` for English)
* and `{REGION}` is a two-letter uppercase string identifying the regional dialect
* of this language (e.g., `US` for United States, `GB` for Great Britain, etc.).
* The currently configured languages (see the @{get_preferred_languages} function)
* determine which translation file gets loaded. If no translation file exists for the
* preferred languages, the next best translation will be chosen by ignoring the
* `{REGION}` code (i.e., if the preferred language is `enGB`, this enables automatic
* fallback to `enUS` if `enGB` is not found). You can also add additional folders
* to scan using the @{load_translations} function, and load a specific translation file
* using the @{load_translation_file} function.
*
* The format of a translation file is simple. It must be a Lua script defining a
* table named `localize`. Each entry in this table will add a new translation to
* the translation database, which is global to the entire GUI (hence, a translation
* defined in one addon can be reused in another addon). An entry in the table must be
* a key + value pair, where the key is the translatable string code (stripped of its
* surrounding braces `{}`) and the value is the translation. The translation can be
* specified as a simple formatted string (see below), or as a full blown Lua function.
*
* If a translatable string code is duplicated in two addons, it will get over-written
* by whichever addon is loaded last.
*
* **Formatted translation strings.** While most translation strings will be simple
* static strings to be displayed as-is, such as `"Cancel"`, it is also possible to
* display dynamic data inside the translated text. One example would be displaying
* a message like "Player1 has lost 10 HP.". There are two dynamic elements in this
* sentence, "Player1" and "10", which cannot be hard-coded into the translation.
* To support this, the translation must be done explicitly in Lua, by supplying
* these two dynamic values to the translation function. For example:
*
*     local player = "Player1"
*     local hp_lost = 10
*     message:set_text(localize_string("{player_lost_hp}", player, hp_lost))
*
* The translation must then refer to these dynamic elements to include them in the
* displayed test. Dynamic elements are always indicated with pairs of braces `{}`.
* Inside the braces, you can supply additional modifiers which will affect how the
* data is being displayed. This follows the [fmtlib](https://fmt.dev/latest/syntax.html)
* syntax. For example, the message above can be represented with the string
*
*     ["player_lost_hp"] = "{} has lost {} HP.",
*
* By default, dynamic elements will be displayed in the same order as they are
* supplied to the @{localize_string} function. You can override this by explicitly
* specifying the position of the argument (recommended, even if the order
* is the same):
*
*     ["player_lost_hp"] = "{0} has lost {1} HP.",
*
* This allows re-using a single element multiple times, e.g.:
*
*     ["player_lost_hp"] = "{0} has lost {1} HP ({0} is hurt!).",
*
* Numbers will be displayed with a very simple, locale-independent formatting
* by default. This is fine for most uses (small integers), but might be confusing
* when displaying fractional values, or very large numbers. In general, it is
* preferable to rely on the user's locale for this, and this can be enabled
* by the `L` modifier (recommended for displaying all numbers):
*
*     ["player_lost_hp"] = "{0} has lost {1:L} HP.",
*
* **Translation functions.** In some cases, the translation is too complex to
* be supported with the formatting syntax described above. This includes cases
* where a word needs to be modified based on gender, quantity, or other properties,
* in ways very specific to the user's language.
*
* This is where translation functions can be used instead of strings. Reusing the
* example from the previous section, an equivalent as a translation function could
* be:
*
*     ["player_lost_hp"] = function (player, hp_lost)
*         return player.." has lost "..hp_lost.." HP."
*     end,
*
* Now, we can actually change the displayed text based on how much HP have been lost:
*
*     ["player_lost_hp"] = function (player, hp_lost)
*         if hp_lost > 10 then
*             return player.." has lost "..hp_lost.." HP!!! Ouch."
*         elseif hp_lost == 0 then
*             return player.." has lost no HP. This had no effect."
*         else
*             return player.." has lost "..hp_lost.." HP."
*         end
*     end,
*
* By default, the numbers printed this way may not be identical to the ones obtained
* from translation strings such as `"{} has lost {} HP."`. This is because Lua
* has its own number formatting rules. To ensure consistency with the rest of the
* translations, you should use the @{format_string} function:
*
*     ["player_lost_hp"] = function (player, hp_lost)
*         if hp_lost > 10 then
*             return format_string("{0} has lost {1:L} HP!!! Ouch.",
                    player, hp_lost)
*         elseif hp_lost == 0 then
*             return format_string("{0} has lost no HP. This had no effect.",
                    player)
*         else
*             return format_string("{0} has lost {1:L} HP.", player, hp_lost)
*         end
*     end,
*
* This can be used to implement complex language rules like adding an "s" to
* plurals of nouns in French:
*
*     -- Table for plurals that are not obtained by just adding "s"
*     special_plurals = {
*         ["cheval"] = "chevaux",
*         ["choux"] = "choux",
*         -- etc...
*     }
*
*     function plural_modifier(word, quantity)
*         if quantity > 1 then
*             local special = special_plurals[word]
*             if special ~= nil
*                 return special
*             else
*                 return word.."s"
*             end
*         else
*             return word
*         end
*     end
*
*     -- English translation would be: "Player1 ate 3 apples."
*     localize = {
*         ["object_apple"] = "pomme",
*         ["object_horse"] = "cheval",
*         ["object_cabbage"] = "choux",
*         ["player_ate_objects"] = function (player, quantity, object)
*             local object_name = localize_string(object)
*             if quantity == 0 then
*                 return format_string("{0} n'a pas mangé de {1}.",
*                     player, object_name)
*             else
*                 object_name = plural_modifier(object_name, quantity)
*                 return format_string("{0} a mangé {1} {2}.",
*                     player, quantity, object_name)
*             end
*         end,
*     }
*
* **Language selection.** By default, the preferred languages are automatically detected
* based on the environment and configuration of the operating system. The `LANGUAGE`
* environment variable is scanned first, and can be used to set an ordered list of
* preferred languages. This is commonly set on Linux and OSX systems, but rarely on
* Windows. For Windows, if `LANGUAGE` is not set, the language configured in the operating
* system is used. For other systems, the `LANG` environment variable is tried next. If
* no language could be detected, the library falls back to US English. This automatic
* detection can be overridden by calling @{set_preferred_languages}.
*
* Once a language (or list of languages) is set, the GUI must be told which characters,
* represented here as Unicode "code points", can be displayed on screen. This can be detected
* automatically from the preferred languages by calling @{auto_detect_allowed_code_points}. This
* function only needs to be called if the preferred languages were overridden with
* @{set_preferred_languages}. If using the automatically-determined language from the environment
* and operating system (see above), this is already done internally.
*
* If the automatic detection of the allowed code points is incomplete, or if additional code
* points need to be displayed for any reason (game-specific lore, etc.), it is possible to add
* more code points to the allowed list with @{add_allowed_code_points_for_language},
* @{add_allowed_code_points_for_group}, and @{add_allowed_code_points}. It is also possible to
* reset the list of allowed code points using @{clear_allowed_code_points}, in the event that
* the automatic detection was completely wrong.
*
* **Encoding.** The Lua API only supports UTF-8 encoding for strings and files. Please make
* sure to only use this encoding when writing scripts and translation files.
