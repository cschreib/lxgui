* Description: Yet unreleased video game project. The screenshot demonstrates most of the UI elements on a single screen. This is all built with standard lxgui, except the "world frames" (small insets in the two leftmost windows, rendering a region of the game world on top of UI elements). The 2D rendering of the world elements is also done using lxgui's renderer.
